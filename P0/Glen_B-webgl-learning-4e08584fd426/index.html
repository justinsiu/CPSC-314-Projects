    <h3>Project 0, CPSC 314 Jan 2016</h3>

<i>Out: Wed Jan 13 2016. Due: Tue Jan 19 2016, 11:59pm</i>

<p> This preliminary project will get you started with the course, and
has four parts. First, you'll make sure that your machine is set up
with the infrastructure you need, including using either a text editor
or an IDE to edit JavaScript, configuring your web browser to access
local JavaScript files, version control (for example with git). You'll
also want to check out the basics of JavaScript if you haven't used it
before. Second, you'll get started with running an example
WebGL/JavaScript program and making a few simple changes to it, and
learning how to use your browser's JavaScript debugger to inspect and
change the running program. Third, you will also read the academic
conduct guidelines for the course and certify that you understand
them. Fourth, you'll set up and test the handin command.

</p><p>This preliminary "Project 0" is mandatory but not marked; we
will not mark your Project 1 until we see that <tt>p0</tt> has been
handed in as required below.

<p></p>
It's up to you whether to use your own laptop or the lab machines in CS Room
005. We recommend making sure that you can work on both platforms.

  <li><b>Development Environment</b>
	  <p><ul><li><b>Editing Code</b>
		  <p>You will need to edit Javascript and HTML
		  files on your machine. You have two choices: a standard text editor,
		  or an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) like Eclipse.</p>
		  
		  <ul><li><b>Standard text editor</b>: You can simply edit Javascript and
			  HTML files with your favorite text editor, reload the file in the
			  browser to run the new code, and use the built-in debugging support
			  in the browser. One popular multiplatform code editor is <a
			  href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">sublime</a>. The default simple
			  editors TextEdit for Macs and Notepad for Windows are also popular.
			  Just remember that you should <b>never</b> try to use Microsoft Word
			  for coding!</li>
			  
		  <p><li><b>IDE</b>: You can also can edit Javascript
			  files through the Eclipse IDE, which should be familiar to you from
			  working with Java files in previous courses. If you have not used Eclipse
			  for Javascript before, see the <a href="http://www.htmlgoodies.com/html5/javascript/scripting-made-easier-with-the-eclipse-javascript-development-tools-jsdt.html#fbid=DWalsCdItAO">Getting Started in
			  Eclipse with JavaScript</a> resource page.</li>
		</ul>
	</li><p><li><b>Web Browser</b>
		<p>We recommend using either Chrome or Firefox. You may run
		into compatability problems with Safari or Internet Explorer. 
	</li><p><li><b>Running Local Code</b>

		<p>Since JavaScript is typically sent
		from a server, by default most web browsers do not allow
		accessing JavaScript files stored on your local computer, for
		security reasons. However, while you are developing WebGL/JS in
		this course, you will find it very useful to be able to access
		local files, for example JavaScript libraries! There are two
		solutions.</p>
		<p>The easiest option, which we recommend, is to simply enable
		your browser to run local JavaScript. On Chrome in Linux, you
		will need to start the program with the command-line flag
		<tt>google-chrome --allow-file-access-from-files</tt>. 
		On Mac OS quit Chrome and use the command <pre>open -a "Google Chrome" --args --allow-file-access-from-files</pre>. 
		Here
		are several pages with instructions on how to enable local file
		access:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li><a
			  href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/How-to-run-things-locally">Three.js
			  guide to running things locally</a> (multiple browsers)</li>
			  
		  <li>Chrome instructions from <a href="http://www.chrome-allow-file-access-from-file.com/">www.chrome-allow-file-access-from-file.com</a></li>
		  <li>Another Chrome guide from <a href="http://voxelent.com/local-chrome/">voxelent</a></li>
		  <li><a
			  href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Links_to_local_pages_do_not_work">Firefox
			  instructions for running locally</a>.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>The alternative solution is to install and run a web server on your
		computer, such as WAMP or LAMP.</p>
		
		</li>
			
	</li>

		<p><li><b>Version Control</b>
			<p>We strongly recommend that you use
			version control. It's particularly crucial for teams, but it's
			highly desireable even if you're working individually. We recommend
			<a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a>, but you are welcome to use
			another package if you prefer. 
			<ul><li><a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Download git</a> and
				install it if you do not already have git loaded on your
				machine. If you will be using Eclipse, then download 	<a
				href="http://www.eclipse.org/egit/download/">EGit</a> as well.</li> 
			<li>We recommend using <a
			href="https://bitbucket.org/">BitBucket</a> because it
			allows you to make a private repo for free. Note that <a
			href="https://github.com/">github</a> only allows public
			repos if you're using it for free. (You do need to keep
			your code for this course private!)
			</li></ul>
			
		</li>
			<p><li><b> JavaScript Basics</b>
				<p>You will need to familiarize yourself with the basic
				syntax of JavaScript. 
				<ul><li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript">JavaScript tutorial</a>,
					reasonable place to start if you haven't used JavaScript at all before
				<li><a href="https://autotelicum.github.io/Smooth-CoffeeScript/literate/js-intro.html">Compact description of JavaScript</a>, 
					particularly good for people who have a solid understanding of Java already</li>
				<li><a
					href="http://javascriptissexy.com/category/16-important-javascript-concepts/">Important
					concepts of JavaScript</a>, further reading on JavaScript </li>
				<li><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/">JavaScript API</a></li> 
			  </ul>
	  </li></ul>
			  
	  <p><li><b>Example WebGL/JavaScript Code</b>

			<p>The example code <a
		  href="https://bitbucket.org/Glen_B/webgl-learning">PO
		  Webgl-Sandbox</a> uses Physijs, which is a wrapper for the
		  ammo.js project, which is a port of the Bullet physics
		  library. </li>

	  <ul><p><li><b>Download Files</b>
		  <p>
		  <ul><li>You can either <a
		  href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone">clone</a> the git
		  repository, or just download the source (as a tar or zip
		  file):
			  <ul><li>to clone the repository on the command line, using the command <pre>git clone https://Glen_B@bitbucket.org/Glen_B/webgl-learning.git</pre>
			  <li>or you can <a
				  href="https://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/User_Guide#Cloning_or_adding_Repositories">clone
				  the repo using eclipse</a> </li>
			  <li>or you can <a href="https://bitbucket.org/Glen_B/webgl-learning/get/master.tar.gz">download the repository</a> and unpack it with
				  the command <tt>tar -xvzf </tt> <i>filename</i><tt>.tar.gz</tt>.
			  </li>
			</ul>
	  </ul>
  </li><p><li><b>Run Code</b>
	  <ul>
		<p><li>Load the file <tt>example/vehicle.html</tt> in your
			browser. You should see a red car that you can drive forward
			by pressing the up arrow key; turn using the left and right
			arrow keys. The physics simulation includes collision and
			friction computations: try crashing the car into the blocks
			to see what happens! 
			<p>This HTML file loads the JavaScript file
		  <tt>examples/vehicle.js</tt> file that is loaded by
			<tt>examples/vehicle.html</tt>.
		</li></ul>

	</li><p><li><b> Edit and Debug JavaScript</b>

		<p> If you're using Eclipse, start it up and import the
		project. If you're using a text editor, load the file into it.
		Just reload the page in the browser to see the results of your
		edits.
		
		<p>The debuggers in both Chrome and Firefox have very similar capabilities:
		<ul>
		  <li><a href="https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/javascript-debugging">Debugging in Chrome</a></li>
		  <li><a href="http://getfirebug.com/javascript">Debugging in Firefox</a></li> 
		</ul>
		
		<p>	Try using the debugger built into your browser to do each of these operations:
		<ul>
		  <li>Setting breakpoints</li>
		  <li>Stepping in and over</li>
		  <li>Printing/showing values</li>
		  <li>Changing variables</li>
		</ul>
		
	</li>

	</li><p><li><b> Make Changes </b></li>

		<p> There are three primary code changes that you should make in <tt>example/vehicle.js</tt>. 
		Search for the string "CHANGE", which marks the locations in the code
		where you should make your edits. 
		
		<ol>
		  <li>
			  CHANGE: the force applied from the engine. Something
		  like 3000 has an interesting effect. 
		  </li>
		  <li>
			  CHANGE: the number of boxes in the simulation. Try decreasing to a
			  small number, like 5. Try increasing to a large number, like 500, and
			  notice how the simulation slows down. 
		  </li>
		  <li>
			  CHANGE: Try adding some new geometry in the scene. For example,
			  try using cones instead of boxes. Hint: you might want
		  to reduce the number of cones!  
		  </li>
		</ol>

	</li><p><li><b>Take Screenshot</b>
		<p>Take a screenshot of the browser window after you have changed the number of
		boxes in the simulation. Use the built-in capabilities of
		your operating system (Linux, Mac, or Windows). Your
		screenshot should be in PNG format. Instructions: 
		<ul>
		  <li><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows/take-screen-capture-print-screen#take-screen-capture-print-screen=windows-8">Windows screenshots</a>
		  <li><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT201361">Mac screenshots</a>
		  <li><a href="http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2012/08/screenshot-ubuntu/">Linux screenshots</a>
		</ul>
  </ul>
		</p><li><b>Academic Conduct Guidelines</b>

    <p>
    </p><ul> <li>Carefully read through the three pages that deal with plagiarism,
    cheating, and academic misconduct:
    <ul><li>Course-specific guidelines at <a href="http://www.ugrad.cs.ubc.ca/~cs314/Vjan2016/cheat.html">http://www.ugrad.cs.ubc.ca/~cs314/Vjan2016/cheat.html</a>
        </li><li>Tamara's general discussion at <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/courses/cheat.html">http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/courses/cheat.html</a>
        </li><li>Department guidelines at <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/about/policies/collaboration.shtml">http://www.cs.ubc.ca/about/policies/collaboration.shtml</a>
    </li></ul>
    <li>As part of this lab, you will to confirm that you have read and understood these
    guidelines. Ask Tamara right
    away if you
    have any questions, either on Piazza, by email, or in person. 
    </li></ul>

    <p>
	</p></li><li><b>Handin</b>

		<p>You will now set up and test the process of handing in your
		project using the <tt>handin</tt> command.
		
		<ul><li>Make a new
			directory called <tt>cs314</tt> in your home directory, and then
			a subdirectory within that called <tt>p0</tt>. It's best to
			have keep your working directories separate from your handin
			directories, and just copy files over when you're ready to hand
			things in.</li>
			
		<li> For this
			assignment, you will only need to hand in four files.
			<ul><li> A screenshot in png format of the simulation after it
				has been modified with a different number of boxes</li>
			<li>the JavaScript file vehicle.js (which should have
				minor alterations)</li>
			<li> the HTML file vehicle.html</li>
			<li> a README.txt file that includes
				<ul><li> name, account id (four or five characters), and
					student number for every member of the team (or just you, if
					you're working individually)</li>
				<li>A very brief
					description of what changes you made to the P0 source.</li>
				<li> The statement
					statement "I/we have read and understood the cheating policies at
					http://www.ugrad.cs.ubc.ca/~cs314/Vjan2016/cheat.html".</li>
			  </ul>
		</ul>
	</li><li> Hand in this project with the command <pre>handin cs314 p0</pre>
		You do not need to be in any particular directory to run this
		command; handin will automatically use the contents of
		<tt>~/cs314/p0</tt> no matter what directory you are in when you
		run it.
		
	</li><li> You can check what you have handed in at any time by simply
		looking at the contents of the directory. You should also check
		using <tt>handin -c</tt> to doublecheck that the handin was
		successful. 
	</li></ul>
